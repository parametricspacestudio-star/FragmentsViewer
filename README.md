# Fragments Viewer

This is a lightweight viewer [Fragments (.frag)](https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_fragment) files. The example model is provided by [Enzyme APD](https://www.weareenzyme.com), and was exported with the [Archicad Fragments Exporter](https://github.com/bimdots-dev/FragmentsArchicadAddOn).
